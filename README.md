#Angular Project: Frontend Storefront

This is a simple storefront made with AngularJS.  I completed this project by following the Codeschool tutorial "Shaping Up with Angular".  

This tutorial is available for free at:

[https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js)

It's a really fun tutorial that covers a lot of the basics of AngularJS.  The explanations are helpful and the concepts are explained clearly.  

There is also an excellent discussion forum for additional support should you get stuck with anything.

## Features

- Dependency injection (e.g. custom store directives are injected into the app's 'gemStore' module)
- JSON data
- Twitter Bootstrap and custom CSS styling
- Custom element and attribute directives to refactor index.html file
- Interactive image gallery

- AngularJS form validation
